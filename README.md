### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

##About myself
I'm Riya, currently pursuing master's in Building Performance and Diagnostics at Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture in the United States. 

Before diving into my graduate studies, I worked as both an architect and a research professional in India's energy and environment sector. My role as a Research Associate at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) allowed me to actively contribute to policy development, consultancy, and research in the field of building sciences and climate change. 

I had the privilege of working on various projects with UNEP, BEE, MoHUA, DSIR, GIZ, World Bank, Saint Gobain, and Mahindra Lifespaces during my time at TERI. I strongly believe in a collaborative approach to mainstream sustainable urban development, at the nexus of innovative technology, applied research, performance, and durability.

Core interest: Building Science + Technology, Circularity in Built Environment, Policy and Research: Energy & Environment, Health and well-being, Sustainability and Material Use, Community Development
